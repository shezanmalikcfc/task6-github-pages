# Task 6 – Host a Static Website with GitHub Pages

This repo contains a simple static site for my DevOps internship Task 6.

## What I did
- Created `index.html` and `style.css`
- Pushed to a new GitHub repository
- Enabled GitHub Pages: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: `Deploy from a branch` → Branch: `main` / `(root)`**
- Opened the live URL shown by GitHub Pages

## Update the site
Edit files → commit → push. Pages auto‑redeploys in ~1–2 minutes.

## Files
- `index.html` – home page
- `style.css` – minimal styling
- `screenshots/` – add your screenshots from the process
